   <h1>
   Who came first: Man, or Language?
   </h1>
   <a href="index.html"><img src="images/10.png"></a>
    <p>
The chicken, no, the egg, no, the chicken, no, no, no, no, noooo, the egg!!!!
The age-old question of which came first - the chicken or the egg - has been 
the topic of countless discussions, both seriously and sarcastically. 
Despite the numerous theories and arguments put forth, there seems to be no universally agreed-upon answer.
This dilemma, familiar to most of us, can leave one's head spinning. <br>
<a href="index.html"><img src="images/13.png"></a
<br>
But what about a similarly perplexing 
question: did language come before humans, or did 
humans come before language? This linguistic riddle, 
while less well-known, is just as fascinating and controversial.
Questions like these are enough to make your head spin right off your neck.
 And for anybody who understands linguistics and its complexities, 
 this argument can be a reason to be kept awake at night by such quandaries.
 If we ask whether man or language came first, most people might answer "man." 
 The answer is evident since for human beings to survive, they need to communicate, 
 and for that, they need language.<br>
 </br>
 

 To begin with, the question arises: aren't 
 there other creatures in the world with advanced brains communicating with or 
 interacting with one another? The answer is yes. Then why do we define language
 as the only set of manufactured sounds? The answer is that we do not understand
 their language because we do not understand their sounds. But here we go again 
 to make it a little spicy and create another controversy, like the egg-chicken
 riddle. <br>
 </br>
 <a href="index.html"><img src="images/12.png"></a>
 
"Language has developed from fundamental human needs; it is not a well-planned
 construct, and humans created it." "Because there would be less disorder and 
 deregulation in the language if it were a divine creation," argued renowned 
 historical linguist Johann Gottfried Herder. So, until now, we can infer that 
 man came first. <br>
 </br>
 
 
There are, however, typical variances in the statement about language not being
 a divine creation. Because there were dinosaurs before humans, and we are still
 trying to figure out what was even before them.While it's widely accepted that
 humans created language to meet their fundamental needs, some argue that it was 
 divinely inspired. However, this view raises questions about the communication
 methods of creatures that existed before humans, such as dinosaurs. How did these
 creatures communicate, and did they have their own languages? These questions 
 highlight the complexity of language and the challenges of defining it universally.
 <br></br>
 

Interestingly, to date, the meaning or definition of language has been limited to
the production of sounds, but the concept of language is broad. So, before concluding
 the answer to the question of who came first, we must give a universal definition 
 of language. Every living thing on earth has a language, and every creature, even 
 nature, has a language. Because without language, people, animals, and other natural
 creatures would be unable to communicate with one another. We constantly try 
 to understand the languages of many unknown beings in this world. So, before 
 defining language, one must believe how extensive, universal, and dynamic
 language is. <br>
 </br>
 
 
In recent times, scientists have observed sound waves from space that are 
generated by space objects. So, based on the sound production and communication
 matrix, can we call it a "language"? Maybe. Let us see how!<br>
 </br>
 <a href="index.html"><img src="images/11.png"></a>
 
Those sound waves communicate crucial details and give us more reasons to 
know about space. Do we understand what these waves say to us? Yes, we do 
(scientifically). Therefore, it can be called a language. On the other hand,
 people who are born mute can also communicate with sign language, which does
 not even produce sounds. So, every matrix has an opposition or contradiction 
 here. So, is there any specific matrix to define language universally? <br>
 </br>
 <a href="index.html"><img src="images/14.png"></a>
 
Therefore, giving a universal definition of language is challenging because 
language is not absolute but relative. It is connected to myriad significant 
aspects of our existence in the universe. This dilemma leads us to the relativity 
of language and compares all aspects of its origin, evolution, and dynamism.<br>
</br>

While the question of whether man or language came first may never have a 
definitive answer, a closer examination of the complexities of language 
reveals the power and beauty of this uniquely human tool." It's also 
important to understand what we learned throughout our lives about
 language might be wrong, how we can make them less wrong, and why 
 it is crucial to connect the dots backward to move forward. But, 
 by delving into the depths and complexity of this debate, we can
 gain a deeper grasp of the power and beauty of language and the 
 myriad ways in which it shapes our world and our understanding 
 of ourselves." <br>
 </br>
 <a href="index.html"><img src="images/15.png"></a>

  Most importantly, this debate leads us to the following questions
-"What implications does our evolving understanding of language have
 for our relationship with the natural world?" or "How might our
 understanding of language change in the coming years, and what 
 impact might this have on society?"
